This project focuses on predicting YouTube channel revenue using machine learning models trained on video/channel performance metrics. The goal is to help creators and analysts better understand how various factors impact revenue generation and optimize their content strategies.

🔍 Project Overview
YouTube is one of the largest video-sharing platforms, where creators earn revenue through ads, memberships, and sponsorships. Predicting this revenue based on channel analytics such as views, likes, comments, and subscriber count can offer insights for growth and monetization strategies.

This project builds and deploys a machine learning model to:

Predict estimated revenue of a YouTube channel/video.

Identify important features influencing revenue.

Provide a user-friendly interface (optional) or REST API for predictions.
🧠 ML Model
Model Type: (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression – update based on your model)

Features Used:

Number of views

Likes

Dislikes

Comments

Subscriber count

Video duration

Engagement rate, etc.

Target Variable: Estimated Revenue (USD)

💾 File: youtube_revenue_predictor.pkl
This is the trained machine learning model saved using Python's pickle module. It can be loaded and used for prediction as shown:

python
Copy
Edit
import pickle

# Load the trained model
with open('youtube_revenue_predictor.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Predict revenue (replace with actual input data)
sample_input = [[500000, 20000, 300, 1200, 1000000]]  # Example input features
predicted_revenue = model.predict(sample_input)

print(f"Predicted Revenue: ${predicted_revenue[0]:.2f}")
🚀 Future Improvements
Integrate with YouTube API to fetch real-time channel/video data.

Deploy a web app using Streamlit or Flask.

Enhance feature engineering with audience retention, watch time, etc.

Build interactive dashboards using Plotly or Power BI.

✅ Requirements
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
📊 Dataset
Note: Dataset used for training the model is not included due to platform restrictions. Replace with your own YouTube Analytics dataset or public data from Kaggle.

📌 Conclusion
This tool empowers content creators to predict potential earnings based on channel performance metrics and make data-driven decisions to enhance growth and engagement.
